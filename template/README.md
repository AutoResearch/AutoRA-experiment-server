# Web-based Behavioral Closed Loop Experiment

This project, generated by Copier from [the AutoRA-experiment-server repo](https://github.com/gt-sse-center/AutoRA-experiment-server), is the website that is served to the participant. The data store gets populated with conditions from the autora-runner and stores observations when participants visit the website. The autora-runner will read the observations and pass them to the theorist.

To start the web app locally you can simply run the start script from a terminal.

```shell
./start.sh
```

### ViteJS + NodeJS + npm 

This project uses "vanilla" Javascript, the [`ViteJS`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#building-the-app) dev build server, and [`npm`](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/an-introduction-to-the-npm-package-manager) for Javascript dependency management. The frontend is defined, including its dependencies, in the [`package.json`](package.json) file.

### FastAPI

This project uses [`FastAPI`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/) for the backend web framework and [`uvicorn`](https://www.uvicorn.org/) as a web server.
